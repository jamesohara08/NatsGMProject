This code is a JavaScript powered web app that allows a user to select players to fill a hypothetical 2020 Washington Nationals roster while following the actual budget and luxury tax costs. The code can be modified to work with any team, with the user having to: 

* modify the roster spot buttons (lines 186-217)
* change line 220 to be "Already [Team Name]" and make the same change in the Category field in nats.csv
* change line 14 to point to the new nats.csv file
* update the nats.csv file with obtainable players at any positions not originally included
